# Multizoo - A SwiftUI Multiplication Game for Kids

**Multizoo** is an interactive animal-themed multiplication game, intended for kids. Multizoo was a mini project to help me learn the following SwiftUI concepts:
- Utilizing the assets catalog to use images and custom colors
- Using Built-in SwiftUI views such as Stepper and Picker to handle user input
- Implicit animations

## Demo
<img src="Assets/demo.gif" width="300" />

## Features

- Supports multiplication table from 2-10
- Colorful animal-themed interface to keep users engaged
- Adjustable number of rounds
- Score tracking and feedback
